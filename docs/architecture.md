# Multi-Device Synchronization Architecture

go-oversync provides a complete synchronization system for building multi-device applications. The oversync server package enables seamless data sharing across multiple devices with automatic conflict resolution, change tracking, and offline-first capabilities.

## Overview

go-oversync is a server library that synchronizes client databases by providing HTTP endpoints that support the oversync protocol. **SQLiteNow** is a Kotlin Multiplatform project that provides client libraries for data synchronization with SQLite databases, allowing developers to build mobile apps that sync with go-oversync servers.

### Architecture

- **go-oversync Server**: Library that plugs into your HTTP server to provide sync endpoints
- **Oversync Protocol**: Standardized protocol for multi-device synchronization
- **Client Libraries**: SQLite clients (Go oversqlite, Kotlin Multiplatform SQLiteNow)
- **Your HTTP Server**: Built using go-oversync library to handle sync requests
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Server-side storage for the authoritative dataset

This architecture is designed for real-world multi-device applications where users expect their data to be available and consistent across all their devices. Whether it's a note-taking app, task manager, or collaborative tool, go-oversync handles the complex aspects of data synchronization automatically.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Change Tracking** - Tracks all INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations on sync-enabled tables
- **Conflict Resolution** - Optimistic concurrency control with automatic conflict detection
- **Offline-First** - Works seamlessly offline, syncs when connection is available
- **Secure Authentication** - Pluggable authentication with any system (JWT, sessions, API keys)
- **Incremental Sync** - Efficient sync with pagination and change-based updates
- **Foreign Key Aware** - Respects database relationships and ordering constraints

## How It Works

go-oversync follows a simple but powerful client-server pattern:

1. **Register tables** you want to synchronize with the oversync service
2. **Add HTTP handlers** to your existing server using go-oversync library
3. **Configure authentication** between your clients and the sync server
4. **Bootstrap client devices** to prepare for sync operations
5. **Sync regularly** to keep data consistent across devices

go-oversync handles all the complex aspects automatically - change tracking, conflict resolution, network failures, and data consistency. Your HTTP server manages the authoritative state and coordinates between all connected devices.

## Architecture Overview

go-oversync follows a client-server architecture using the oversync protocol:

1. **Client Libraries** track local changes and periodically sync with the server
2. **HTTP Server** (built with go-oversync library) maintains the authoritative state in PostgreSQL and resolves conflicts
3. **Changes** are tracked at the row level with timestamps and device attribution
4. **Conflicts** are resolved using optimistic concurrency control when the same data is modified on multiple devices

```

This architecture ensures data consistency while allowing offline operation and handling network interruptions gracefully. Your HTTP server, built using the go-oversync library, acts as the central coordinator, storing all data in PostgreSQL and managing synchronization between all connected clients.
